            <p>Baba Painter is a serious interactive art installation
            serving two purposes: first, as a training and
            experimental restoration installation for restoration
            experts to practice and hone their skills, and secondly,
            for the creation of fun, social networking activities.</p>

            <p>Following years of restoration, Baba House on Neil
            Road, Singapore, managed by NUS Museum, has been restored
            to its former glory, reflecting the sophistication,
            opulence, intricacies and charm of the Peranakan
            culture. Some artifacts however, like the Phoenix and
            Peony remain unrestored because the restoration team felt
            that they had neither the skill, expertise or knowledge to
            restore it. Members of the general public, children,
            students and scholars, alike, are invited to engage in the
            restoration activity and upload their creations to a
            shared internet site where others can view and critique
            their creations in a fun and social way.</p>
